**Files to Create:**

```
docs/SECURITY.md
SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md
.github/workflows/security-scan.yml
```

**Phase 6 Checkpoint:** Final report on test coverage, security posture, documentation completeness, production readiness.

---

## Success Criteria

**Testing:**

- Overall test coverage ≥85%
- Safety-critical code coverage ≥90%
- All tests passing
- Load tests successful at 10x current capacity

**Security:**

- Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities
- All authentication flows secured
- API security hardened
- Security audit passed

**Performance:**

- API response times <200ms (p95)
- Agent success rate >99.5%
- Weather data accuracy >95%
- Route calculations <3s for complex routes

**Documentation:**

- All features documented with examples
- All external integrations documented
- Deployment procedures complete
- Troubleshooting guides comprehensive

**External Integrations:**

- All APIs production-grade (no mocks)
- Proper error handling implemented
- Rate limiting and quotas monitored
- Cost tracking implemented
- Fallback strategies operational

## Checkpoint Protocol

After each Phase completion:

1. Comprehensive phase summary
2. Test coverage report with metrics
3. Performance impact assessment
4. Security considerations reviewed
5. Documentation completeness check
6. External service status and costs
7. Issues/blockers encountered
8. Recommendations for next phase

**CRITICAL:** Request explicit approval before proceeding to next phase.

## External Service Summary

Services requiring provisioning:

1. ECMWF API (weather)
2. UK Met Office DataPoint (weather)
3. Windy API (weather)
4. Noonsite (port information)
5. OpenSeaMap (marina data)
6. AIS Data Provider (vessel tracking)

Each will trigger a PAUSE with detailed provisioning documentation before implementation.
