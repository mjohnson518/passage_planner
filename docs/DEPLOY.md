## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend won't start on Railway
- Check the logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Make sure PostgreSQL and Redis are running

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Check CORS error in browser console
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct
- Make sure Railway app is running

### WebSocket not connecting
- Check URL uses `wss://` not `ws://` in production
- Verify Railway allows WebSocket connections (it does by default)
- Check browser console for connection errors
